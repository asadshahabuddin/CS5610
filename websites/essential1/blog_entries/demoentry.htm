    The experiments for Week 2 are mainly focused on Twitter's Bootstrap framework by exploring the associated tags, elements, classes and style properties. The learning process for this week involved responsive design, navigation bars, tabbed interfaces, typography, panels, carousels and accordions. The experiments completed for the week have been listed below.

            <a href="../experiments/html/06-bootstrap-navbar.html">Bootstrap Navigation Bar - Responsive Design. </a>
            <span>
                Twitter's Bootstrap framework has been used to create a navigation bar which is resposive to the screen size (phones, tablets, laptops and desktops) along with the rest of the page. We mainly focus on the navigation bar and its elements, utilizing Bootstrap's classes to format it and create an inverted version of the same. The items form part of a drop down list from a contextual button on the top-right in the case of a small screen and expands to a full-blown menu as it is stretched to a larger size. Other elements have also been added to make the page complete.

            <a href="../experiments/html/07-bootstrap-tabs.html">Bootstrap Tabs. </a>
            <span>
                This page illustrates the use of Twitter's Bootstrap framework to create a tabbed interface. Every tab leads to a separate section with the corresponding content. The 'nav' class and 'tab data-toggle' property has been used used to achieve the desired effect. There are a total of five sections (tabs) on this page and cliking on them leads to the desired section. A custom CSS file is referenced in addition to the Bootstrap CSS files, which in turn defines the properties to provide background and other style sheet information for the navigation bar.

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/08-bootstrap-schedule.html">Carousels - Class Schedule. </a>
            <span>
                Schedule of classes for the Spring 2015 Semester has been presented in a carousel-based interface defined in the Bootstrap framework. Each slide/carousel-item presents the schedule for a specific subject. The course name is used as the background text for a slide, with the main area composed of all other information associated with the highlighted subject. The last slide represents an empty slot. Navigation is made using arrow keys to the left and right or the bubbles at the bottom of a slide. In addition to these, automatic transition occurs after a fixed interval.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/09-bootstrap-elements.html">Bootstrap Elements and Semantics. </a>
            <span>
                The page is used to showcase various elements in the Bootstrap framework. This includes a progress bar and an accessibility guide composed of various kinds of labels meant for a variety of scenarios. A traffic signal guide is created using some of the label colors. The progress bar is at a 100% completion to show the page load status. Each of these elements are placed inside their own division tags and the entire body is enveloped by a 'container' division, which comes with its own specific styling.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/10-bootstrap-horoscopes.html">Accordion - Daily Horoscope. </a>
            <span>
                Accordian menus are used to create a daily horoscope page in the form of a navigation list. Clicking on a horoscope title opens up the description which is a complete horoscope summary for the day. The accordian widget results in lucid collapsible components. The first element is open by default. Clicking on another title opens up the corresponding description and closes the other, whereas clicking on the same title again closes all the components. Panels are used to create the overall interface.
