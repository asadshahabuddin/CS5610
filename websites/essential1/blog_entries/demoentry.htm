    The experiments for Week 2 are mainly focused on Twitter's Bootstrap framework by exploring the associated tags, elements, classes and style properties. The learning process for this week involved responsive design, navigation bars, tabbed interfaces, typography, panels, carousels and accordions. The experiments completed for the week have been listed below.
    <br />

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/06-bootstrap-navbar.html">Bootstrap Navigation Bar - Responsive Design. </a>
            <span>
                Twitter's Bootstrap framework has been used to create a navigation bar which is resposive to the screen size (phones, tablets, laptops and desktops) along with the rest of the page. We mainly focus on the navigation bar and its elements, utilizing Bootstrap's classes to format it and create an inverted version of the same. The items form part of a drop down list from a contextual button on the top-right in the case of a small screen and expands to a full-blown menu as it is stretched to a larger size. Other elements have also been added to make the page complete.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/07-bootstrap-tabs.html">Bootstrap Tabs. </a>
            <span>
                This page illustrates the use of Twitter's Bootstrap framework to create a tabbed interface. Every tab leads to a separate section with the corresponding content. The 'nav' class and 'tab data-toggle' property has been used used to achieve the desired effect. There are a total of five sections (tabs) on this page and cliking on them leads to the desired section. A custom CSS file is referenced in addition to the Bootstrap CSS files, which in turn defines the properties to provide background and other style sheet information for the navigation bar.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/08-bootstrap-schedule.html">Carousels - Class Schedule. </a>
            <span>
                Schedule of classes for the Spring 2015 Semester has been presented in a carousel-based interface defined in the Bootstrap framework. Each slide/carousel-item presents the schedule for a specific subject. The course name is used as the background text for a slide, with the main area composed of all other information associated with the highlighted subject. The last slide represents an empty slot. Navigation is made using arrow keys to the left and right or the bubbles at the bottom of a slide. In addition to these, automatic transition occurs after a fixed interval.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/09-bootstrap-elements.html">Bootstrap Elements and Semantics. </a>
            <span>
                The page is used to showcase various elements in the Bootstrap framework. This includes a progress bar and an accessibility guide composed of various kinds of labels meant for a variety of scenarios. A traffic signal guide is created using some of the label colors. The progress bar is at a 100% completion to show the page load status. Each of these elements are placed inside their own division tags and the entire body is enveloped by a 'container' division, which comes with its own specific styling.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/10-bootstrap-horoscopes.html">Accordion - Daily Horoscope. </a>
            <span>
                Accordian menus are used to create a daily horoscope page in the form of a navigation list. Clicking on a horoscope title opens up the description which is a complete horoscope summary for the day. The accordian widget results in lucid collapsible components. The first element is open by default. Clicking on another title opens up the corresponding description and closes the other, whereas clicking on the same title again closes all the components. Panels are used to create the overall interface.

    jQuery is the topic for this week. The experiments were spent in exploring various methods, events and actions of the jQuery library. jQuery AJAX, JavaScript regular expressions and jQuery UI have also been put to use in completing most of the work.
    <br />

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/11-jq-image-slideshow.html">jQuery Events - Image Slideshow. </a>
            <span>
                jQuery (JavaScript) events have been used to create an image slideshow. An initial image is displayed on the webpage until a mouse click event occurs, upon which it changes to something else. This continues in a loop using the images specified in the scripts. JavaScript inspects the current image and assigns another on mouse click based on the existing one. The division size has been hard-coded to maintain layout uniformity. Click on the image to try it yourself.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/12-jq-animate.html">jQuery Animations. </a>
            <span>
                The jQuery animate() method has been utilized to create division and text based animations. A click on the 'Animate' button starts the sequence. First of all, the text changes, followed by a change in width, height, opacity level and text size. The animation sequence continues with a subsequent reduction in height and width respectively. This would be the final state of our division tag. Another click on the animate button starts the process over. However, the text and opacity level do not change.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/13-jq-unfold.html">jQuery Slide - Product Unveil. </a>
            <span>
                The Product Unveil page uses jQuery's slide method and mouse events to unveil a new product. This page is populated with the name, contextual image, specifications and description of the product. In its initial state, the page displays a title and an inverted area sensitive to a mouse click event. On clicking it, the page unveils itself and the product. For clarity and a professional look, the clickable area hides itself on clicking.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/14-jq-ajax.html">jQuery AJAX and Regex - Movie of the Day. </a>
            <span>
                An AJAX call is employed to query IMDB and generate a movie page. The response is a JSON object with detailed information about the movie in various fields such as name, abridged and complete plot, poster, languages, writers, etc. The object is converted to a plain text string which is then parsed using regular expressions to extract the name, complete plot and movie poster. Finally, this filtered information undergoes formatting and is displayed on the HTML page. The response format is JSONP and 'My API Films' is used to get the request URI.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../experiments/html/15-jq-autocomplete.html">jQuery Autocomplete - U.S. State Search. </a>
            <span>
                A typeahead search is presented for the 50 U.S. States. The field works as expected. You may type in a part of the name of any of the states and this field shows suggestions based on your search token. Any text value one character and up is treated as a valid search token. If no suggestions appear, there are no matching states. jQuery UI and its autocomplete feature have been utilized to achieve the desired result. Custom CSS has been applied to format the drop down menu.
