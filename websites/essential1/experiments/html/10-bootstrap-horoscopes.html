                Accordian menus are used to create a daily horoscope page in the form of a navigation list. Clicking on a horoscope title opens up the description which is a complete horoscope summary for the day. The accordian widget results in lucid collapsible components. The first element is open by default. Clicking on another title opens up the corresponding description and closes the other, whereas clicking on the same title again closes all the components. Panels are used to create the overall interface.

                                A rush of intense love and romantic passion for a special someone might turn your mind toward marriage, Aries. The wedding of a friend may contribute to these thoughts. Your partner may still have doubts about moving to the next level of commitment, even though there's no question that he or she truly loves you. Be patient and hold your tongue. You will know when the time is right.

                                Love, passion, romance, and marriage - your mind will focus on these matters all day even if there's no special person in your life right now, Gemini. If you are involved, don't be surprised if talk of a long-term commitment creeps into your conversations with your beloved. If you aren't involved, someone new and exciting could appear on the scene.

                                The approach of a very special visitor might cause you to thoroughly clean your house, Cancer. Afterward, you could look for new and interesting ways to dress it up with some new plants, throw pillows, or other decorative touches. This can be tiresome, but definitely worthwhile. When your friend arrives, he or she will feel at home. Work hard and then make yourself look great.

                                Romantic novels and movies could be more appealing than usual today, Leo. You're in an especially intense mindset. If you're involved, your relationship could be near the point where it has to move ahead or end. Chances are it will move ahead. If you aren't attached, your loving nature will attract more than one potential partner into your aura. Be prepared, and expect the unexpected.

                                Your financial situation could get a strong boost today, Virgo. This might be due to a contract you've just signed, perhaps involving some work you will do on your own rather than for an employer. The project may have strong personal significance. The creative arts could be involved, as well as technology. Be prepared for a busy month, but it will be a great one. Go for the gold!

            <h3>Accordian and Collapsible Components</h3>
            <p>
                Panels and panel groups are used to encapsulate collapsible components, with the 'panel-group' id set to 'accordion' to fetch the suitable Bootstrap component. Collapsible data toggles are used to ensure that clicking on a navigation title toggles the collapsible property of that accordion. A division tag set to 'in' class remains open by default. Clicking on another item opens it up and closes others.
